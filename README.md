# v
Quick access to recent files in Vim

**This depends on [MRU](https://github.com/vim-scripts/mru.vim) plugin in vim.**


# Installation
1. Install [MRU](https://github.com/vim-scripts/mru.vim) plugin for Vim
2. Put `v` somewhere in $PATH (e.g. /usr/local/bin/).

# Usage

Usage: `$ v <term>`

Example: `$ v readme`

# Customize
You have one small customization that you can do.

You can change the number of recent entries that the script should look into.
This is the same number of entries that `v` will show if you use `v` without any arguments

`$ v`

You can change it in the script. Just change the variable limit in the beginning.
